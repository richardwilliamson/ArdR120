# ArdR120
Arduino project to allow a Strand R120 remote to work with Eos over TCP using the ESP8266 chip - developement done using an Adafruit Huzzah board with a Max232 chip to shift the serial data to RS232 levels - PCB design is in the PCB folder

Specifically targetted to work with the Stage Electrics version of the R120 which has fewer buttons and a smaller display, but is a much nicer box, so all the features can be accessed with the reduced number of buttons 

# User
The remote can be configured to send commands either as the connnected console's own user, or a specified user. Note that a limitation of the EOS OSC API currently means that all OSC devices share a user - which is a pain!

# Shift keys

@Att button is effectively shift, but has different behaviour to the shift button on the console in order to leverage additonal remote functionality

The following commands are accepted:

[@ATT][Clr] = clear command line

[@ATT][Go] = go to cue

[@ATT][Cue] = cue only

[@ATT][Rec] = update

[@ATT][0] = sneak

[@ATT][1] = preset

[@ATT][2] = intensity pallette

[@ATT][3] = Focus pallette

[@ATT][4] = Colour pallette

[@ATT][5] = Beam pallette

[@ATT][6] = Live

[@ATT][7] = Blind

[@ATT][8] = Patch

[@ATT][9] = Park

[@ATT][@] = Address (for Stage Electrics remotes without a Dim key)

[@ATT][+] = Park

#Differences to labelled buttoned

[ON] equates to eos [Level]

[DIM] equates to eos [Address]

[up arrow] equates to +% and -%

#Setup

Press and hold the ESP's on board button (pin 0) for 2 seconds to do a full factory reset, note that once restarted you will be in bootloader mode, so press the reset button to run normally

Setup commands are accessed by pressing [@ATT]  [@ATT] (press @ATT twice), followed by the option below, press [Rem Dim] at any time while in setup to exit without saving

Press [*] to confirm settings
[up] and [down] will move left/right where applicable

CHANGED THE BELOW....

[1] = Display current settings of device, cursor up/down to scroll through 

[2] = Set console user (0 > 254), 0 will revert to the connected console's user (meaning commands will appear on that console's command line and vice-versa

[3] = Set console IP (in future implement OpenSLP so you can discver the console on the network..)

[4] = Select DHCP/static IP, if Static you will be prompted for subnet mask and gateway

[5] = Select Wifi network (use up and down to cycle through), pressing [*] will take you to the password entry.

[6] enable remote setup - the device will turn into a Wireless Access Point named "ArdR120-xxx" with the password "12345678" - navigate to 192.168.4.1 in your browser. The AP will run until saved - alternatively you can press REMDIM on the remote and the AP will quit and device restart..

[7] enable webserver - this allows you to configure the device by typing the IP address into a browser on a device on the same wireless network. 1=ON, 2=OFF

[9] = Enter bootloader mode (needs arduino IDE for now) - TODO enable web upload somehow.. Maybe through Wifi Manager, this is for 'engineer' use only and will probably eventually be removed..



#current problems/TODO

No / key so can't set addresses on other universes - maybe use . somehow?

Need to tidy up how screen displays information

When recalling macros command line on remote doesn't show that you are typing a macro (as it doesn't appear on console command line), maybe replace top line with this sort of thing, could also display the SHIFT mode, and the below stop/go stuff..

Similarly STOPBACK and GO don't display - maybe need a mechanism to show "special" messages for a short duration

special chars not yet working in on device wifi config..

Check that user saves/loads properly everywhere

An interrupt in the wifiManager so that if you press a key on the remote wifiManager will quit..

Check what happens if things don't connect, and that device can recover OK from all problems..
